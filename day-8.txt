Authentication TYPES:
=========================

Authentication depends on how API's are designed 

1.No Auth -> no Authentication req and Acess API Directly

2.API Key -> we require API key to acees to some API's

3.Bearer Token-> we need to generate token 

4.Basic Auth-> we req username and pwd (not in encrypted format)

5.Digest Auth-> we req username and pwd ( Encrypted format)

Below two are Most secured Third-party Authentications:
-----------------------------------------------
6.OAuth 1.0 

7.OAuth 2.0 -> next version of OAuth1.0

Repositaory github access -> personal access Token
User specific Access -> Oauth token

Uploading Files via API
=========================
Step-1:
we have jar file which needs to run below cmd in cmd prompt

java -jar file-upload-RestAPI.jar

This is developed using sprint boot application

Step-2:
Now u can use below urls for uploading file
Single file Uploading- https://localhost:8080/uploadFile
Multiple files upload- https://localhost:8080/uploadMultipleFiles

Step-3:
Create a POST Request and under Body select 
Body -> form-data -> select file/files from dropdown.

cUrl and Swagger
================
Swagger -> interactive document (in coument we can able to do somekind of testing 
                                 that interacts with server)
								 
								 
Main difference btw Swagger and Postman
==========================================
swagger is used for exploring API's
Swagger we cannot perfirm any validations
swagger cannot generate reports
Swagger we cannot perform API Chaining


cURL-> (Client URL )consolidated String which contains all the information of particular API.

Purpose and Use?
From Curl by default request is genrared and bydefault it creates Authenctication,headers,body etc..

postman -> import-> raw text -> past curl and send
